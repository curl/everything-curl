# Everything curl

*Everything curl* is an extensive guide for all things curl. The project
itself, the command-line tool, the library, how everything started and how it
came to be the useful tool it is today. It explains how we work on developing
it further, what it takes to use it, how you can contribute with code or bug
reports and why millions of existing users use it.

This book is meant to be interesting and useful to both casual readers and
somewhat more experienced developers. It offers something for everyone to pick
and choose from. 

Do not read this book from front to back. Read the chapters or content you are
curious about and flip back and forth as you see fit.

This book is an open source project in itself: open, completely free to
download and read. Free for anyone to comment on, and available for everyone
to contribute to and help out with. Send your bug reports, ideas, pull
requests or critiques to us and I or someone else will work on improving the
book accordingly.

This book will never be finished. I intend to keep working on it. While I may
at some point consider it fairly complete, covering most aspects of the
project (even if only that seems like an insurmountable goal), the curl
project will continue to move so there will always be things to update in the
book as well.

This book project started at the end of September 2015.
