# BoringSSL

## build boringssl

$HOME/src is where I put the code in this example. You can pick wherever you
like.

    $ cd $HOME/src
    $ git clone https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl
    $ cd boringssl
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=on ..
    $ make

## set up the build tree to get detected by curl's configure

In the boringssl source tree root, make sure there is a `lib` and an `include`
dir. The `lib` directory should contain the two libs (I made them symlinks
into the build dir). The `include` directory is already present by
default. Make and populate `lib` like this (commands issued in the source tree
root, not in the `build/` subdirectory).


    $ mkdir lib
    $ cd lib
    $ ln -s ../build/ssl/libssl.a
    $ ln -s ../build/crypto/libcrypto.a


## configure curl

`LIBS="-lpthread -lstdc++" ./configure --with-ssl=$HOME/src/boringssl` (where I point out
the root of the boringssl tree)

Verify that at the end of the configuration, it says it detected
BoringSSL to be used.

## build curl

Run `make` in the curl source tree.

Now you can install curl normally with `make install` etc.
