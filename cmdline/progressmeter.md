# Progress meter

curl has a built-in progress meter. When curl is invoked to transfer data
(either uploading or downloading) it can show that meter in the terminal
screen to show how the transfer is progressing, namely the current transfer
speed, how long it has been going on and how long it thinks it might be left
until completion.

The progress meter is inhibited if curl deems that there is output going to
the terminal, as the progress meter would interfere with that output and just
mess up what gets displayed. A user can also forcibly switch off the progress
meter with the `-s / --silent` option, which tells curl to hush.

If you invoke curl and do not get the progress meter, make sure your output is
directed somewhere other than the terminal.

curl also features an alternative and simpler progress meter that you enable
with `-# / --progress-bar`. As the long name implies, it instead shows the
transfer as a progress bar.

At times when curl is asked to transfer data, it cannot figure out the total
size of the requested operation and that then subsequently makes the progress
meter contain fewer details and it cannot, for example, make forecasts for
transfer times, etc.

## Units

The progress meter displays bytes and bytes per second.

It also uses suffixes for larger amounts of bytes, using the 1024 base system
so 1024 is one kilobyte (1K), 2048 is 2K, etc. curl supports these:

| Suffix  |  Amount | Name      |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| K       | 2^10    | kilobyte  |
| M       | 2^20    | megabyte  |
| G       | 2^30    | gigabyte  |
| T       | 2^40    | terabyte  |
| P       | 2^50    | petabyte  |

The times are displayed using H:MM:SS for hours, minutes and seconds.

## Progress meter legend

This is the progress meter shown for each single transfer when doing them in a
serial manner. When parallel transfers are enabled, curl instead uses the
format described below.

The progress meter exists to show a user that something actually is happening.
The different fields in the output have the following meaning:

    % Total  % Received % Xferd Average Speed          Time             Curr.
                                Dload  Upload Total    Current  Left    Speed
    0  151M  0 38608    0     0  9406      0  4:41:43  0:00:04  4:41:39  9287

## Parallel progress meter

When --parallel is used, curl can do many transfers simultaneously and then
the above mentioned progress meter does not really work as it then needs to
tell the user the status about a large number of transfers in a single status
line.

When curl does parallel transfers, it might only have size information about a
subset of the data until late in the process, which makes it often show a few
blank fields. For example it cannot tell a total expected transfer time until
it knows the expected content size of all involved transfers.
