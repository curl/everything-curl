# FTP type

This is not a feature that is widely used.

URLs that identify files on FTP servers have a special feature that allows you
to also tell the client (curl in this case) which file type the resource
is. This is because FTP is a little special and can change mode for a transfer
and thus handle the file differently than if it would use another mode.

You tell curl that the FTP resource is an ASCII type by appending `;type=A` to
the URL. Getting the `foo` file from the root directory of `example.com` using
ASCII could then be made with:

    curl "ftp://example.com/foo;type=A"

curl defaults to binary transfers for FTP, but the URL format allows you to
specify the binary type with `type=I`:

    curl "ftp://example.com/foo;type=I"

Finally, you can tell curl that the identified resource is a directory if the
type you pass is D:

    curl "ftp://example.com/foo;type=D"

â€¦this can then work as an alternative format, instead of ending the path
with a trailing slash as mentioned above.
