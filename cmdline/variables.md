# Variables

This concept of variables for the command line and config files was added in
curl 8.3.0.

A user sets a *variable* to a plain string with `--variable varName=content` or
from the contents of a file with `--variable varName@file` where the file can be
stdin if set to a single dash (`-`).

A variable in this context is given a specific name and it holds contents. Any
number of variables can be set. If you set the same variable name again, it
gets overwritten with new content. Variable names are case sensitive, can be
up to 128 characters long and may consist of the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and
underscore.

Some examples below contain multiple lines for readability. The backslash
(`\`) is used to instruct the terminal to ignore the newline.

## Setting variables

You can set variables at the command line with `--variable` or in config files
with `variable` (no dashes):

    curl --variable varName=content

or in a config file:

    # Curl config file

    variable varName=content

## Assigning contents from file

You can assign the contents of a plain text file to a variable, too:

    curl --variable varName@filename

## Expand

Variables can be expanded in option parameters using `{{varName}}` when the
option name is prefixed with `--expand-`. This makes the content of the
variable `varName` get inserted.

If you reference a name that does not exist as a variable, a blank string is
inserted.

Insert `{{` verbatim in the string by escaping it with a backslash:

`\{{`.

In the example below, the variable `host` is set and then expanded:

    curl \ 
        --variable host=example \
        --expand-url "https://{{host}}.com"

For options specified without the `--expand-` prefix, variables are not
expanded.

Variable content holding null bytes that are not encoded when expanded causes
curl to exit with an error.

## Environment variables

Import an environment variable with `--variable %VARNAME`. This import makes curl
exit with an error if the given environment variable is not set. A user can
also opt to set a default value if the environment variable does not exist,
using `=content` or `@file` as described above.

As an example, assign the `%USER` environment variable to a curl
variable and insert it into a URL. Because no default value is specified, this
operation fails if the environment variable does not exist:

    curl \ 
        --variable %USER \
        --expand-url "https://example.com/api/{{USER}}/method"

Instead, let's use `dummy` as a default value if `%USER` does not exist:

    curl \
        --variable %USER=dummy \
        --expand-url "https://example.com/api/{{USER}}/method"

Or get the default contents from a local file:

    curl \
        --variable %USER@file \
        --expand-url "https://example.com/api/{{USER}}/method"

## Expand `--variable`

The `--variable` option itself can also be expanded, which allows you to
assign variables to the contents of other variables.

    curl \
        --expand-variable var1={{var2}} \
        --expand-variable fullname="Mrs {{first}} {{last}}" \
        --expand-variable source@{{filename}}

Or done in a config file:

    # Curl config file

    variable host=example

    expand-variable url=https://{{host}}.com

    expand-variable source@{{filename}}

## Functions

When expanding variables, curl offers a set of *functions* to change how they
are expanded. Functions are applied with colon + function name after the
variable, like this: `{{varName:function}}`.

Multiple functions can be applied to the variable. They are then applied in a
left-to-right order: `{{varName:func1:func2:func3}}`

These functions are available: `trim`, `json`, `url` and `b64`

## Function: `trim`

Expands the variable without leading and trailing white space. White space is defined as: 

* horizontal tabs
* spaces
* new lines
* vertical tabs
* form feed and carriage returns

This is extra useful when reading data from files.

    --expand-url "https://example.com/{{path:trim}}"

## Function: `json`

Expands the variable as a valid JSON string. This makes it easier to insert
valid JSON into an argument (The quotes are not included in the resulting
JSON).

    --expand-json "\"full name\": \"{{first:json}} {{last:json}}\""

To trim the variable first, apply both functions (in this order):

    --expand-json "\"full name\": \"{{varName:trim:json}}\""


## Function: `url`

Expands the variable URL encoded. Also known as *percent encoded*. This
function ensures that all output characters are legal within a URL and the
rest are encoded as `%HH` where `HH` is a two-digit hexadecimal number for the
ascii value.

    --expand-data "varName={{varName:url}}"

To trim the variable first, apply both functions (in this order):

    --expand-data "varName={{varName:trim:url}}"

## Function: `b64`

Expands the variable base64 encoded. Base64 is an encoding for binary data
that only uses 64 specific characters.

    --expand-data "content={{value:b64}}"
    
To trim the variable first, apply both functions (in this order):

    --expand-data "content={{value:trim:b64}}"

Example: get the contents of a file called `$HOME/.secret` into a variable
called `fix`. Make sure that the content is trimmed and percent-encoded sent
as POST data:

    curl \
        --variable %HOME=/home/default \
        --expand-variable fix@{{HOME}}/.secret \
        --expand-data "{{fix:trim:url}}" \
        --url https://example.com/ \
