## The development team

Daniel Stenberg is the founder and self-proclaimed leader of the
project. Everybody else that participates or contributes in the project has
thus arrived at a later point in time. Some contributors worked for a while
and then left again. Most contributors hang around only for a short while to
get their bug fixed or feature merged or similar. Counting all contributors
we know the names of, we have received help from more than 1300 individuals.
