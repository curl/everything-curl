## The name

Naming things is hard.

The tool was about uploading and downloading data specified with a URL. It was a client-side
program (the 'c'), a URL client, and would show the data (by default). So 'c' for Client and URL: **cURL**.

Nothing more was needed so the name was selected and we never looked back
again.

Later on, someone suggested that curl could actually be a clever "recursive
acronym" (where the first letter in the acronym refers back to the same word):
"Curl URL Request Library"

While that is awesome, it was actually not the original thought. We wish we
were that clever…

There are and were other projects using the name curl in various ways, but we
were not aware of them by the time our curl came to be.

### Pronunciation

Most of us pronounce "curl" with an initial k sound, just like the English
word curl. It rhymes with words like girl and earl. Merriam Webster has a
[short WAV file](https://media.merriam-webster.com/soundc11/c/curl0001.wav) to
help.

### Confusions and mixups

Soon after our curl was created another "curl" appeared that created a
programming language. That curl still [exists](http://www.curl.com).

Several libcurl bindings for various programming languages use the term "curl"
or "CURL" in part or completely to describe their bindings. Sometimes
you will find users talking about curl but referring to neither the command-line tool
nor the library that is made by this project.

### Used as a verb

'To curl something' is sometimes used as a reference to use a non-browser tool
to download a file or resource from a URL.
