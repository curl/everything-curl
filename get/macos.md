# Get curl for macOS

macOS comes with the curl tool bundled with the operating system since many
years. If you want to upgrade to the latest version shipped by the curl
project, we recommend installing [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (a macOS
software package manager) and then install the curl package from them:

    brew install curl

### Get libcurl for macOS
