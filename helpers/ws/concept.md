# Concept

A libcurl application can do WebSocket using one of these two different
approaches below.

## 1. The callback approach

It can decide to use the regular [write callback](../../transfers/callbacks/write.md)
to receive incoming data, and respond to that data in or outside of the
callback with `curl_ws_send`. Thereby treating the entire session as a form of
download from the server.

Within the write callback, an application can call `curl_ws_meta()` to
retrieve information about the incoming WebSocket data.

## 2. The connect-only approach

The other way to do it, if using the write callback is not suitable, is to set
`CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY` to the value `2L` and let libcurl do a transfer that
only sets up the connection to the server, does the WebSocket upgrade and then
is considered complete. After that *connect-only* transfer, the application
can use `curl_ws_recv()` and `curl_ws_send()` to receive and send WebSocket
data over the connection.

## Upgrade or die

Doing a transfer with a `ws://` or `wss://` URL implies that libcurl makes a
successful upgrade to the WebSocket protocol or an error is returned. An HTTP
200 response code which for example is considered fine in a normal HTTP
transfer is therefore considered an error when asking for a WebSocket transfer.

## Automatic `PONG`

If not using [raw mode](options.md), libcurl automatically responds with the
appropriate `PONG` response for incoming `PING` frames and does not expose
them in the API.
