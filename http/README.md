# Command line HTTP

In all user surveys and during all curl's lifetime,
[HTTP](../protocols/http.md) has been the most important and most frequently
used protocol that curl supports. This chapter explains how to do effective
HTTP transfers and general fiddling with curl.

This mostly works the same way for HTTPS, as they are really the same thing
under the hood, as HTTPS is HTTP with an extra security TLS layer. See also
the specific HTTPS section.
