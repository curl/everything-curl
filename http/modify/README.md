# Customize your HTTP

As described earlier, each HTTP transfer starts with curl sending a *request*.
This request consists of a request line and a number of request headers, and
this chapter details how you can customize those.

* [Request method](method.md)
* [Request target](target.md)
* [Fragment](fragment.md)
* [Customize headers](headers.md)
* [Referer](referer.md)
* [User-agent](user-agent.md)
* [Ranges](ranges.md)
* [Conditionals](conditionals.md)
* [Compression](compression.md)

Of course, changing the [HTTP version](../versions/) is another way to alter
the request.
