# Linux

Linux distributions come with packager managers that let you install software
that they offer. Most Linux distributions offer curl and libcurl to be
installed if they are not installed by default.

## Ubuntu and Debian

`apt` is a tool to install prebuilt packages on Debian Linux and Ubuntu Linux
distributions and derivatives.

To install the curl command-line tool, you usually just

    apt install curl

â€¦and that then makes sure the dependencies are installed and usually
libcurl is then also installed as an individual package.

If you want to build applications against libcurl, you need a development
package installed to get the include headers and some additional
documentation, etc. You can then select a libcurl with the TLS backend you
prefer:

    apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev

or

    apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev

## Redhat and CentOS

With Redhat Linux and CentOS Linux derivatives, you use `yum` to install
packages. Install the command-line tool with:

    yum install curl

You install the libcurl development package (with include files and some docs,
etc.) with this:

    yum install libcurl-devel

## Fedora

Fedora Workstation and other Fedora based distributions use `dnf` to install packages.

Install the command-line tool with:

    dnf install curl

To install the libcurl development package you run:

    dnf install libcurl-devel

## Immutable Fedora distributions

Distributions such as Silverblue, Kinoite, Sericea, Onyx, ...
use `rpm-ostree` to install packages.
Remember to restart the system after install.

    rpm-ostree install curl

To install the libcurl development package you run:

    rpm-ostree install libcurl-devel

## nix

[Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) is a package manager default to the NixOS
distribution, but it can also be used on any Linux distribution.

In order to install command-line tool:

    nix-env -i curl

## Arch Linux

curl is located in the core repository of Arch Linux. This means it should be 
installed automatically if you follow the normal installation procedure.

If curl is not installed, Arch Linux uses `pacman` to install packages:
    
    pacman -S curl

## SUSE and openSUSE

With SUSE Linux and openSUSE Linux you use `zypper` to install
packages. To install the curl command-line utility:

    zypper install curl

In order to install the libcurl development package you run:

    zypper install libcurl-devel

### SUSE SLE Micro and openSUSE MicroOS

These versions of SUSE/openSUSE Linux are immutable OSes and have a read
only root file system, to install packages you would use `transactional-update`
instead of `zypper`. To install the curl command-line utility:

    transactional-update pkg install curl

To install the libcurl development package:

    transactional-update pkg install libcurl-devel

## Gentoo

This package installs the tool, libcurl, headers and pkg-config files etc

    emerge net-misc/curl

## Void Linux

With Void Linux you use `xbps-install` to install packages.
To install the curl command-line utility:

    xbps-install curl

In order to install the libcurl development package:

    xbps-install libcurl-devel
