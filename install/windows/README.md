# Windows

Windows 10 comes with the curl tool bundled with the operating system since
version 1804. If you have an older Windows version or just want to upgrade to
the latest version shipped by the curl project, download the latest official
curl release for Windows from
[curl.se/windows](https://curl.se/windows/) and install that.

There are several different ways to get curl and libcurl onto your Windows
systems:

1. [MSYS2](win-msys2.md)
2. [vcpkg](win-vcpkg.md)
