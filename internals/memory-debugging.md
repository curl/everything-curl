# Memory debugging

The file `lib/memdebug.c` contains debug-versions of a few functions.
Functions such as `malloc()`, `free()`, `fopen()`, `fclose()`, etc that
somehow deal with resources that might give us problems if we leak them. The
functions in the memdebug system do nothing fancy, they do their normal
function and then log information about what they just did. The logged data
can then be analyzed after a complete session,

`memanalyze.pl` is the perl script present in `tests/` that analyzes a log
file generated by the memory tracking system. It detects if resources are
allocated but never freed and other kinds of errors related to resource
management.

Internally, the definition of the preprocessor symbol `DEBUGBUILD` restricts
code which is only compiled for debug enabled builds. The symbol `CURLDEBUG`
is used to differentiate code which is _only_ used for memory
tracking/debugging.

Use `-DCURLDEBUG` when compiling to enable memory debugging, this is also
switched on by running configure with `--enable-curldebug`. Use
`-DDEBUGBUILD` when compiling to enable a debug build or run configure with
`--enable-debug`.

`curl --version` lists the `Debug` feature for debug enabled builds, and lists
the `TrackMemory` feature for curl debug memory tracking capable builds. These
features are independent and can be controlled when running the configure
script. When `--enable-debug` is given both features get enabled, unless some
restriction prevents memory tracking from being used.

## Track Down Memory Leaks

... using the memory debug system. In general, we suggest using valgrind a the
first choice.

### Single-threaded

Please note that this memory leak system is not adjusted to work in more than
one thread. If you want/need to use it in a multi-threaded app. Please adjust
accordingly.

### Build

Rebuild libcurl with `-DCURLDEBUG` (usually, rerunning configure with
`--enable-debug` fixes this). `make clean` first, then `make` so that all
files are actually rebuilt properly. It also makes sense to build libcurl with
the debug option (usually `-g` to the compiler) so that debugging it gets
easier if you actually do find a leak in the library.

This builds a library that has memory debugging enabled.

### Modify Your Application

Add a line in your application code:

    curl_dbg_memdebug("dump");

This makes the malloc debug system output a full trace of all resources using
functions to the given filename. Make sure you rebuild your program and that
you link with the same libcurl you built for this purpose as described above.

### Run Your Application

Run your program as usual. Watch the specified memory trace file grow.

Make your program exit and use the proper libcurl cleanup functions etc. So
that all non-leaks are returned/freed properly.

### Analyze the Flow

Use the `tests/memanalyze.pl` perl script to analyze the dump file:

    $ tests/memanalyze.pl dump

This now outputs a report on what resources that were allocated but never
freed etc. This report is fine for posting to the list.

If this does not produce any output, no leak was detected in libcurl. Then
the leak is mostly likely to be in your code.
