# --libcurl

We actively encourage users to first try out the transfer they want to do with
the curl command-line tool, and once it works roughly the way you want it to,
you append the `--libcurl [filename]` option to the command line and run it
again.

The `--libcurl` command-line option creates a C program in the provided file
name. That C program is an application that uses libcurl to run the transfer
you just had the curl command-line tool do. There are some exceptions and it
is not always a 100% match, but you might find that it can serve as an
excellent inspiration source for what libcurl options you want or can use and
what additional arguments to provide to them.

If you specify the filename as a single dash, as in `--libcurl -` you get the
program written to stdout instead of a file.

As an example, we run a command to get `http://example.com`:

    curl http://example.com --libcurl example.c

This creates `example.c` in the current directory, looking similar to this:
