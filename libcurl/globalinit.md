# Global initialization

Before you do anything libcurl related in your program, you should do a global
libcurl initialize call with `curl_global_init()`. This is necessary because
some underlying libraries that libcurl might be using need a call ahead to get
setup and initialized properly.

curl_global_init() is, unfortunately, not thread safe, so you must ensure that you
only do it once and never simultaneously with another call. It initializes
global state so you should only call it once, and once your program is
completely done using libcurl you can call `curl_global_cleanup()` to
free and clean up the associated global resources the init call allocated.

libcurl is built to handle the situation where you skip the
`curl_global_init()` call, but it does so by calling it itself instead (if you
did not do it before any actual file transfer starts) and it then uses its own
defaults. Beware that it is still not thread safe even then, so it might cause
some "interesting" side effects for you. It is much better to call
curl_global_init() yourself in a controlled manner.
