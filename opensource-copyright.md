## Copyright

Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the
creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution.

The copyright owner(s) can agree to allowing others to use its work by
licensing it. That's what we do in the curl project. The copyright is the
foundation on which the licensing works.

Daniel Stenberg is the owner of most copyrights in the curl project.

## Independent

A lot of Open Source projects are run within umbrella organizations. Such
organizations include the GNU project, the Apache Software Foundation, a
larger company that funds the project or similar. The curl project is not part
of any such larger organization but is completely independent and free.

No company is controlling its destiny and the curl project does not need to
follow any umbrella organization's guidelines.

## Legal

The curl project obeys to national laws in which it works. It being a highly
international project visible, downloadable and usable in effectively every
single country on earth may of course imply that some local laws can be
circumvented when using curl. That's just the nature of it and if uncertain,
you should check your own local situation.

There have been law suits involving technology that curl provides. One such
case known to the author of this was a patent case in the US that insisted
they had the rights to resumed file transfers.

As a generic software component that is usable everywhere to everyone, there
are times when libcurl - in particular - are used in nefarious or downright
malicious ways or circumstances. Examples include being used in virus and
malware software. That is unfortunate but nothing we can prevent.
