# The cURL project

![curl logo](curl-logo.png)

A funny detail about Open Source projects is that they are called *projects*,
as if they were somehow limited in time or ever can get done. The cURL project
is a number of loosely coupled individual volunteers working on writing
software together with a common mission: to do reliable data transfers with
Internet protocols, as Open Source.
