# The development team

Daniel Stenberg is the founder and self-proclaimed leader of the
project. Everybody else that participates or contributes in the project has
thus arrived at a later point. Some contributors worked for a while and then
left again. Most contributors hang around only for a short while to get their
bug fixed or feature merged or similar. Counting all contributors we know the
names of, we have received help from more than 3,000 individuals.

There is no formal membership or anything that needs to be done to join the
project. If you participate in communication or development, you are part of
the project. Every contributor decides for themselves exactly how much and in
what ways to participate.
