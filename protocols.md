# Network and protocols

Before diving in and talking about how to use curl to get things done, let's
take a look at what all this networking is and how it works. Using
simplifications and some minor shortcuts to give an easy overview.

The basics are in the [networking simplied](protocols-network.md) chapter that
tries to just draw a simple picture of what networking is from a curl
perspective, and the [protocols](protocols-protocols.md) section explains more
on what exactly a "protocol" is and how that works.
