# Network and protocols

Before diving in and talking about how to use curl to get things done, let's
take a look at what all this networking is and how it works, using
simplifications and some minor shortcuts to give an easy overview.

The basics are in the [networking simplified](network.md) chapter that tries
to just draw a simple picture of what networking is from a curl perspective,
and the [protocols](protocols.md) section which explains what exactly a
"protocol" is and how that works.
