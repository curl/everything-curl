# Source code

The source code is, of course, the actual engine parts of this project. After
all, it is a software project.

curl and libcurl are written in C.

## Hosting and download

You can always find the source code for the latest curl and libcurl release on
the official curl website [curl.se](https://curl.se/). There are also
checksums and digital signatures provided to help you verify that what ends up
on your local system when you download the files, are the same bytes in the
same order as were originally uploaded there by the curl team.

If you would rather work directly with the curl source code off the source
code repository, you find all details in [the curl GitHub
repository](https://github.com/curl/curl/).

## Clone the code

    git clone https://github.com/curl/curl.git

This gets the latest curl code downloaded and unpacked in a directory on your
local system.
