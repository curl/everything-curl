# Command line transfers

Previous chapters described curl concepts and something about the basic
command lines. You use command-line options and you pass on URLs to work with.

In this chapter, we are going to dive deeper into doing actual transfers with
curl. What the curl tool can do and how to tell curl to use these features to
send or retrieve data for you. You should consider all these features as
different tools that are here to help you do your file transfer tasks as
conveniently as possible.
