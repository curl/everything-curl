# Downloads

"Download" means getting data from a server on a network, and the server is
then clearly considered to be "above" you. This is loading data down from the
server onto your machine where you are running curl.

Downloading is probably the most common use case for curl â€” retrieving the
specific data pointed to by a URL onto your machine.
