# TLS

TLS stands for Transport Layer Security and is the name for the technology that
was formerly called SSL. The term SSL has not really died though so these days
both the terms TLS and SSL are often used interchangeably to describe the same
thing.

TLS is a cryptographic security layer "on top" of TCP that makes the data
tamper proof and guarantees server authenticity, based on strong public key
cryptography and digital signatures.
